🏪 Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis
📊 Objective

Analyze transactional retail data to identify profit-draining categories, optimize inventory turnover, and uncover seasonal product behavior. The project leverages SQL for data transformation and Power BI for interactive visualization and insight generation.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

SQL (Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Aggregation)

Power BI (Data Visualization & Interactive Dashboard)

Excel / CSV (Data Source)

🗂️ Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation

Import raw transactional data into SQL database.

Clean and standardize records:

Handle missing/null values.

Remove duplicates.

Ensure data types (e.g., dates, currency, and numeric fields) are consistent.

2. SQL Analysis

Calculate key profitability metrics:

SELECT 
    Category,
    SubCategory,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    ROUND(SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales) * 100, 2) AS Profit_Margin_Percentage
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY Category, SubCategory
ORDER BY Profit_Margin_Percentage ASC;


Identify slow-moving and overstocked items using inventory turnover calculations:

SELECT 
    Product_ID,
    Product_Name,
    AVG(Inventory_Days) AS Avg_Inventory_Days,
    ROUND(SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales) * 100, 2) AS Profitability
FROM Inventory_Performance
GROUP BY Product_ID, Product_Name
HAVING Avg_Inventory_Days > 90;


Derive seasonal trends:

SELECT 
    DATEPART(QUARTER, Order_Date) AS Quarter,
    Category,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY DATEPART(QUARTER, Order_Date), Category
ORDER BY Quarter;

3. Power BI Dashboard

Import cleaned SQL views into Power BI.

Create interactive visuals:

Profitability by Category and Sub-Category

Inventory Turnover vs. Profit Margin

Seasonal Sales Trends

Regional Performance Comparison

Add slicers/filters for:

Region

Product Category

Season/Quarter

📈 Insights & Strategic Recommendations

Low-margin categories identified for pricing or supplier renegotiation.

Overstocked items recommended for clearance or promotional campaigns.

High seasonal products highlighted for targeted marketing before peak demand.

Regional variations used to refine distribution and stock levels.
